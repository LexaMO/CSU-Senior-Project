Project Implementation Description & Explanation
==================================================

#### The opening screen of my application includes the tabs of editing features centered in the middle of the application.
![Starting screen](/media/OpeningScreen.png)

#### We can then look at the drop down menus in the top left corner of the screen that will bring up image loading and viewing capabilities along with the keyboard shortcuts that corresponds with a certain function.

#### If we hover over "Edit" at the top, we can see options to copy or paste any image to or from the clipboard

![DropDownMenu](/media/EditDropDown.png)

#### If we hover over "File" at the top, we can see options open an image from the files on the computer, save an image to files, or exit the application.

#### After choosing to open an image and choosing an image from the computer, we can see that the application has loaded the image for editing.

#### If we hover over "View" at the top, we can see options to change the size of the image. We can select "Fit to Window" to scale the image to fit the window (Figure 1) or to zoom in or out and scale the image accordingly (Figure 2)

#### We can also move the tabs containing the editing functions by clicking and dragging the tab from the top, or by clicking the small button to separate the tab from the group. You can also make the tab disappear by clicking the "x" at the top of the tab which can be seen highlighted in light blue (Figure 3). Now we can see the chosen tab has been separated and is now floating (Figure 4 and 5). This tab can now be positioned anywhere on the screen.

#### When moving the floating tabs, you can put them back into the group by holding and releasing the tab on top of another tab to combine them and switch between them by selecting the tab name at the bottom (Figure 6 and 7), or by holding and releasing the tab above or below another tab to reposition them on top of one another (Figure 8 and 9).

#### Going into the editing functions of the application, we can choose any of the buttons within the "Background Color" section to add a color overlay onto the image (Figure 10-14)

##### *(Fig 14.) Adding a cyan color overlay to the image*

#### We can also change the opacity of the image using the slider in the "Image Opacity" section. By moving the slider, you change the opacity of the image, the farther right the slider is, the higher the opacity (Figure 15 and 16)

##### *(Fig 15.) changing the opacity of the image to the middle value using the slider*

##### *(Fig 16.) changing the opacity of the image to the lowest value using the slider*

#### We can also change the size dimensions of the image by choosing a ratio button, where 1:1 is normal size, (Figure 17 and 18)

##### *(Fig 17.) changing the size dimensions of the image by choosing the 2:1 ratio*
