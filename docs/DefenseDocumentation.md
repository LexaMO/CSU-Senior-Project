CSCI 499 Senior Project Defense
===============================================
Project Title: QTCreator Photo Image Editor

Date: April 20, 2022

Student Name: Lexa Mosby

Major: Computer Science

Advisor: Dr. Sean Hayes


## Problem Statement and Purpose:
In a technologically driven society that revolves around photographic documentation, we should be allowed access and opportunity to decent photo editors. Yet many people do not have access to a decent photo editing app, with decent features. Young adults and teenagers are wasting money on costly subscriptions for photo editing software just to get their hands on features they don’t know how to use. And if they don’t buy the subscription, access to a majority of the photo editing features are restricted. I propose building a photo editor to have features that allow the user to make changes to and edit their photos. This solution would be beneficial for those that want to edit photos without putting in a large investment of time and money or have complex photo editing knowledge.

The purpose of this project is to construct a C++ project constructing a Bulk image manipulation tool. This manipulation tool would have features divided by categories, (e.g., colors, sizing), that allow the user to choose what changes they want to make to a photo, and submit to do those changes all at one time instead of making one change at a time. Examples include cropping, custom size editing, color filters, photo effects, auto white balance, stickers, etc.

## Research and Background:

### QTCreator IDE:
- I had to research and experiment with the interface of QTCreator to learn how to use and get familiarized with it since I had never used it or even heard of it prior to this project.

### QTCreator Objects and Classes: 
- Throughout the process I had to reference examples and tutorials built into the IDE in order to learn the format and the difference objects and classes that are built into the software. 
- Classes such as QImage, QLabel, and many more were common topics that I dealt with and researched throughout the process.

## Project Language(s), Software, and Hardware
I used C++ within the QTCreator IDE on my own personal computer.

## Challenges Overcome
I mostly struggled with finding documentation to meet my specific needs for this project. That and getting familiarized with the QtCreator IDE in the first place.

## Future Enhancements
In the future, I would like to advance the interface by adding a drop down menu to remove or add the different function tabs from view. I would also like to add more advanced editing feature such as an undo button, and white balance for the images. I would also like to add a feature to view the before and after to access the changes and differences.
