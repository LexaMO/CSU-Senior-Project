Senior Project Test Plan
========================
Lexa Mosby
----------

Introduction:
-------------
- Overview: This test plan is designed to evaluate the ease and efficiency of the program for all users.
- goals:
  1. to identify the time it takes to edit a single image.
  2. to identify the time it takes to edit multiple images simultaneously.
  3. to identify the ease of use with the program throughout various age groups.

Test Items: 
-----------
- QT Creator
- test and tutorial files used to learn software
- randomly selected images from the internet

Features to be tested:
-----------------------
- ease and usability of program
- actual functions of program:
  - uploading a photo from files
  - zoom in/out
  - crop
  - editing multiple pictures at a time
  - color filter
  - save and download edited photo
  - undo and redo changes made to a photo
  - see a before and after of edited image

Features not to be tested:
--------------------------
- more complex functions of program:
  - white balance 
  - adding visual effects
  - adding a watermark
  

Approach:
--------
Approach to testing includes sessions of having people from different age groups try to use program and efficiently be able to edit multiple images testing every function

Item Pass/Fail Criteria:
-----------------------
Criteria to conclude pass/fail of testing will be the functioning features of the program.
Test Deliverables:

- Test Cases: not available yet
- Test Scripts: not available yet
- Test Reports: not available yet

Test Environment:
-----------------
- QT Creator program

Estimate:
---------
No known estimations

Schedule:
---------
Anticipated schedule estimates a gradual progress of adding editing functions into the scope of capabilities. The schedule includes an anticipated growth of adding or working on a new feature every week.

Assumptions/Dependencies:
-------------------------
- assumptions: development of project will go as planned ending with a finalized project with every feature that was hoped to be incorporated.
- dependencies: software functionality and cooperation, amount of prior research, and progress of project.
