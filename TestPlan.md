Introduction:
-------------
- Overview: This test plan encapsulates the synopsis of progress of c++ program on QT Creator creating a bulk image manipulation tool.
- goal: to outline the progress of current stage in senior project

Project Plan: https://github.com/LexaMO/CSU-Senior-Project/blob/master/SeniorProject.md

Test Items:
-----------
- QT Creator
- test and tutorial files used to learn software

Features to be tested:
-----------------------
- individual files with practice programs for research
- actual functions of program:
  - physical appearance and neatness
  - basic usability and ease of performance

Features not to be tested:
--------------------------
- more complex functions of program:
  - editing functions that require more work (waiting until more basic features of programs are completed)

Approach:
--------
Approach to testing includes trial by error and experimental coding to learn more about software and complete research referred to in Senior Project Proposal.

Item Pass/Fail Criteria:
-----------------------
Criteria to conclude pass/fail of testing will be the functioning features of the program.
Test Deliverables:
-------------------
- Test Plan: 
- Test Cases: not available yet
- Test Scripts: not available yet
- Test Reports: not available yet

Test Environment:
-----------------
- QT Creator
- network

Estimate:
---------
No known estimations

Schedule:
---------
Anticipated schedule estimates a gradual progress of adding editing functions into the scope of capabilities. The schedule includes an anticipated growth of adding or working on a new feature every week.

Assumptions/Dependencies:
-------------------------
- assumptions: development of project will go as planned ending with a finalized project with every feature that was hoped to be incorporated.
- dependencies: software functionality and cooperation, amount of prior research, and progress of project.
