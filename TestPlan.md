Senior Project Test Plan
========================
Lexa Mosby
----------

Introduction:
-------------
- Overview: This test plan is designed to evaluate the ease and efficiency of the program for all users.
- goals:
  1. to identify the time it takes to edit a single image.
  2. to identify the time it takes to edit multiple images simultaneously.
  3. to identify the ease of use with the program throughout various age groups.

Test Items: 
-----------
- QT Creator
- test and tutorial files used to learn software
- randomly selected images from the internet

Features to be tested:
-----------------------
- ease and usability of program
- actual functions of program:
  - uploading a photo from files
  - zoom in/out
  - crop
  - color filter
  - save and download edited photo
  - undo and redo changes made to a photo
  - see a before and after of edited image

Features not to be tested:
--------------------------
- more complex functions of program:
  - white balance 
  - adding visual effects
  - adding a watermark
  - editing multiple pictures at a time
  

Approach:
--------
Approach to testing includes sessions of having people from different age groups try to use program and efficiently be able to edit multiple images testing every function

Item Pass/Fail Criteria: **
-----------------------
 - Subject can:
   - successfully upload picture from files
   - successfully crop image after entering desired dimensions
   - zoom in and out of image 
   - successfully apply color filter on image 
   - undo and redo changes to image 
   - see a before and after of image
   - save edited changes to image

Test Environment:
-----------------
- Manual Testing in non-formal environment using QT Creator program

Schedule:

  -  Post-testing Usability Survey: 5 min
  -  Total: 25- 30 min

Assumptions/Dependencies: **
-------------------------
- assumptions: development of project will go as planned ending with a finalized project with every feature that was hoped to be incorporated.
- dependencies: software functionality and cooperation.
