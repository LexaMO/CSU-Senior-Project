Senior Project Proposal
=======================

Student Name: Lexa Mosby

Advisor: Dr. Hayes

Expected Graduation Date: May 2022

Problem Statement:
------------------
In a technologically driven society that revolves around photographic
documentation, 
we should be allowed access and opportunity to decent photo editors. Yet many 
people do not have access to a decent photo editing app, with decent features. 
Young adults and teenagers are wasting money on costly subscriptions 
for photo 
editing software just to get their hands on features they don’t know how to use. 
And if they don’t buy the subscription, access to a majority of the photo editing 
features are restricted. I propose building a photo editor to have features 
that allow the user to make changes to and edit their photos. This solution 
would be beneficial for those that want to edit photos without putting in a large 
investment of time and money or have complex photo editing knowledge.

Product Description:
--------------------

a C++ project constructing a Bulk image manipulation tool. This manipulation
tool would have features divided by categories, (e.g., colors, sizing), that
allow the user to choose what changes they want to make to a photo, and submit
to do those changes all at one time instead of making one change at a time.
Examples include cropping, custom size editing, color filters, photo effects,
auto white balance, stickers, etc.

**Proposed Implementation Language:** C++

**Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. to be used:** QT

**Additional Software/Equipment Needed:** QT IDE


Personal Motivation:
--------------------

Since we live in the generation where many people take photos and edit them, 
this product is something that I can utitilize and that my friends or anyone 
can use. Also, this project will further my knowledge by allowing me to expand 
my skills in a language that I know by learning new techniques and concepts 
outside of their current capabilities and expertise

Future Research:
----------------

-   Researching/learning how to use QT through tutorials, so that I am familiar
    with the software that I am using to develop my product with.

-   Learn about the different packages available in the QT software to
    familiarize myself with the IDE and utilize helpful features in my project.

-   Researching and learning how to implement events in C++, so that the user
    can click buttons and do actions to actively edit their photo.

-   Research and learn front-end/back-end development methods that I am not
    familiar with in C++ so that I can make the product and make it look neat
    and presentable.

-   Researching how to control image view and image changes through QT IDE for
    presentation and functionality of photo editing features.

-   Research how to access and add certain features that can change an image to
    add into the project, for example: how to add a color filter onto a picture.
